  # General Information about IBS

It evolved into the Center for Banking Studies (CBS) in 1994, expanding its training to both NBC staff and the public. Over the years, with support from international partners and cooperation with institutions like the Banking University of Ho Chi Minh City and the Banking Academy of Vietnam, CBS continuously improved its curriculum. In September 2024, CBS was officially inaugurated as the Institute of Banking Studies (IBS) to further strengthen education and human resource development in banking and finance."
